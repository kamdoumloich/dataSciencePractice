## Data
The fields in the file are as follows:  
1. 'yr': the year in which the birth was registered (e.g. 2018)  
2. 'sex': 'B' for 'boy', 'G' for 'girl'  
3. 'FirstForename'  
4. 'number': the total number of births of that sex, registered in that year, for which that name was the first (or only) forename  
5. 'rank': the rank of that name in that year’s list (for babies of that sex), expressed as a simple number. If two or more names occurred equally often (for that sex) in a given year, they have exactly the same numerical value here, so this field does not directly identify any names which were involved in a tie in rank.  
6. 'position': the rank of the name in that year’s list (of babies of that sex), expressed as a character string. If two or more forenames occurred equally often (for that sex) in a given year, this field gives their numerical rank followed by an equals sign (e.g. '6=' for names that were jointly ranked sixth), so it does indicate if a forename was involved in a tie in rank.
